<h2 align="center"> Bare Metal High Performance AI Final Report </h2>

In this project, we take an AI workfow - [BigGAN](https://github.com/BU-CLOUD-S20/Cloud-native-deployments-of-bare-metal-high-performance-AI-workflows/blob/update-readme/README.md#mit-satori) in our case - that is operational in MIT's HPC [Satori](https://mit-satori.github.io/) (modded with IBM Power PC CPUs, NVIDIA V100 GPUs, etc.) and convert it to a running workflow on OpenShift ([Mass Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/)) to measure similarities and to delineate the process of moving an application from a bare metal environment to a cloud native platform.

The instructions to run BigGAN on Satori are [here](https://github.com/BU-CLOUD-S20/Cloud-native-deployments-of-bare-metal-high-performance-AI-workflows/blob/update-readme/README.md#mit-satori). These instructions are our starting point.

# 2. Running on Satori

We use the instructions to run BigGAN on Satori given [here](https://github.com/BU-CLOUD-S20/Cloud-native-deployments-of-bare-metal-high-performance-AI-workflows/blob/update-readme/README.md#mit-satori). We use 2 GPUs for training. We measured the CPU usage, GPU usage and memory usage while training. 

## CPU usage

Here we notice that the BigGAN workflow consumes just less than 20 % CPU on average.

## Memory usage

The memory usage lingers around 8.3%. For the node that we are running on, this is around 95 GB used of 1145 GB available.

## GPU usage

The GPUs are fully utilized, both GPUs running at almost full capacity. Take note, that this was a shared node, and there might be other users processes running on this GPU node. The workflow can be run in an exlusive node to get the exact usage by only the BigGAN process. However, exclusive nodes are very hard to get scheduled on Satori, in our experience.

## GPU Memory usage

The GPU memory is also pretty well utilized. It is Consistently measured around 80%.

# 3. Running on OpenShift on MOC

We created a docker container that runs the training process of BigGAN. We modified the instructions to run BigGAN on Satori, and use the scripts [here](https://github.com/BU-CLOUD-S20/Cloud-native-deployments-of-bare-metal-high-performance-AI-workflows/tree/feature-gpubiggan/workflows/BigGAN/gpu).
This test used 1 GPU for training. We measured the CPU usage, GPU usage and memory usage while training. 

### CPU usage

Here we notice that the BigGAN workflow consumes just less around 2 % CPU on average.

## CPU usage multiplexed with CPU heavy workload

Now, we ran a CPU-heavy workload multiplexed with the BigGAN workflow. We see that more CPU is definitely more utilized.

## Memory usage

The memory usage lingers around 15%. For the node that we are running on, this is around 84 GB used of 541 GB available.

## GPU & GPU memory usage

The GPU is around 40% utilized. This might be because that the GPU is not used by other users. THe GPU memory usage stays between 5-10%.

TODO: Add CPU and GPU specs, for Satori and OpenShift nodes.
